          <p>Once upon a time, Zoey was a wonderful jumping beagle who liked to jump jump jump like a jelly bean.  She would go VROOOM and then kaaboooom. She would have ears like an airplane.<br>  And jump jump jump away.  She was a run away bandit beagle in her past life but then Brian found her and forced her into cuddles.<br>  Now she never looks back at her time before blankets.  in the <strong>Deep<strong> South.
